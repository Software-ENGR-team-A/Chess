Chess and Balances is an in-development game seeking to re-imagine the classic game of Chess

## üì• Downloading and Playing

As we are very early in development, there are currently no released builds. To try the game out, see **üîß Building / Contributing**

## üîß Building / Contributing

1. Install [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). The project is currently using version **4.4.x**, and does not require .NET
2. Make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed
3. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Software-ENGR-team-A/Chess.git`
4. Open the project in Godot: *Import > `/path/to/chess-and-balances/project.godot` > Open*
5. You can begin playing with the Play button in the top right. To build the project instead, go to *Project > Export...* There are no presets defined yet, so configuring your export is up to you. See [Export ‚Äî Godot Engine](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/index.html)

Code formatting is enforced with [godot-gdscript-toolkit](https://github.com/Scony/godot-gdscript-toolkit). Before requesting a change, run `gdformat .` and check that `gdlint .` is passing from the project directory. Pull requests failing to meet this cannot be merged until this is done.
